Twitter Random Walk
===================

By Franc Camps-Febrer, October 2014

Bored of your Twitter timeline? Are you following too many of the same people?
**Twitter Random Walk** will take all the accounts you follow and replace them with a random account they follow.

## Configuration

For the script to work, you'll need to create a Twitter app and add your key and secret to a file called config.json in the main folder. This file has the following form:

```{
	"consumer_key": "gKUU4oZ3PBZUXV5S1PrGRcux3",
	"consumer_secret": "n2uWvFOxAA7rhKlMN7btydjMQSlN0eIRaALpCeYBgRRAcdWaMp",
	"access_token": "135239774-D1m5HNmFs1wvCvSg9NAlXpYlu04t3WJ8t2CE9BtX",
	"access_secret": "lPckMzQcMtlDebydX03CDzI25MIo79NuKPNPfL3FsIvzq"
}```

## Usage

```node twirawa.js```
